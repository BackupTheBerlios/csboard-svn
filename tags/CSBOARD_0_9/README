CsBoard is a small GUI for gnuchess. It is written in C# and uses gtk-sharp and mono. 
It is simple, but allows you just play chess with SVG graphics and native look and desktop 
theme usage. CsBoard has very detailed user documentation and fully integrated with GNOME 
desktop environment for many things, like support of mime-types.

CsBoard uses gnuchess as an engine, but you can also play with crafty of phalanx.

Currently user part of CsBoard is almost finished, it can satisfy newbie user needs. 
But the requirements of advanced chess users are much more complicated. So the main goal 
is development of architecture that will allow things like ICS (internet chess server) support 
but still keep interface simple.
